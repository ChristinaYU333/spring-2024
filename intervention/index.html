    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        The site chosen for this intervention was Instagram, a platform often criticized for its focus on the superficial and the idealized aspects of life. The aim was to transform this space into one where authenticity and emotional honesty are valued above all. By creating an anonymous page for individuals to share unsent letters and messages, we sought to provide a safe haven for unspoken thoughts and feelings. This initiative may alter the way people interact with social media, encouraging them to move beyond the pursuit of validation through likes and comments, and instead engage in meaningful, empathetic exchange. This could encourage people to embrace and share the imperfect and the unspoken, finding a community that truly values emotional honesty and support.

    Only if I have more time, i would try to host live sessions with mental health professionals, artists, or writers to discuss themes emerging from the letters could provide further depth and engagement. Collaborations with visual artists to interpret and represent stories from the letters in art could offer a new dimension to the project, making the unspoken thoughts and feelings not just heard but also seen.

       When we think about instagram, we think about the unrealistic ,the superficial. This initiative may alter the way people interact with social media, encouraging them to move beyond the pursuit of validation through likes and comments, and instead engage in meaningful, empathetic exchange. This could encourage people to embracing and sharing the imperfect and the unspoken, and finding a community that truly values emotional honesty and support.
